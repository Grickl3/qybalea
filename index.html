		<p>In the Fall of 2020, Doctor Macauley Yacouba Patton, physicist at UC Berkeley, revealed to several colleagues that he intended to demonstrate the connection between modern and arcane theories by summoning a demon. His colleagues were concerned and amused, until — late on the night of December twelfth — Dr. Patton succeeded in his efforts.</p>
		
		<p>Since that fateful night, a slew of mysterious events have occured. The military has intervened. Dr. Patton has died. The demon has escaped. Somehow, you and a handful of others have come into possession of snippets of the story — clues to the conjuring. Before passing, the doctor learned of his errors and how to set them right. And, he has entrusted the task to you.</p>
